Hello, and welcome to my profile.
I am 62 years old. I have a son who will be turning 40 this year. 

I'm the author of a book called "The Thoughts of an Image Writer" that is available on Amazon.![100_3370](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc17f809-808d-4ac2-8b24-2881c947b7cd)


I make and sell beaded jewelry and crafts ![(164) Diamond in Diamond Black   Opal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b54da3fa-fb49-4ae2-bad9-1678cd0bdce7)
 and I'm  taking an updated Website Design Course in order to try to host my own selling site for my jewelry that I can host on my own computer.

Other crafts that I do are painting ![LionResting1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fdde6b4-55af-4004-ae7c-abe95f3e8a09)

and other crafts.  This is just to name a few of them. 

I also like to write poetry, which is the subject of my book, and I love to read and watch movies (ones that I own on DVD or BluRay).

I was raised in Michigan (I've lived in several different cities here), and have lived in California, Florida, Ohio, and Illinois. But I always seem to come back home to Michigan. Right now I'm in Beaverton.
